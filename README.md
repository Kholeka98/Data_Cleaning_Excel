# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the supply chain dataset and answer the following questions:

- What is the revenue generated from each geographical location?
- What relationship exists between price and product quantity sold?
- Which product category generates the highest revenue?


### Data Source
Supply chain dataset URL:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/supply-chain-dataset)

### Tools
Python

### Data Understanding
In the initial data understanding step, we performed the following tasks:
- Data Loading and Inspection.
- Determined the total number of observations and fields.
- Analyzed the statistical characteristics of the numeric columns.
- Determined the data types of the columns.
- Calculated the total number of  null values.

 ### Data Preparation
 As part of preparing our dataset, we executed the following tasks:
 - Dropped irrelevant columns and rows to avoid cleaning colums that are irrelevant to our analysis
 - Identified and removed duplicate rows
 - Renamed columns and included units  where necessary.

### Data Visualizations
We utilized data visualization to comprehend features by creating histograms and scatterplots, aiding in addressing the specified inquiry.

### Results
1. Based on the analysis, we observe that the revenue generated from product sales is distributed as follows:
- 17.76% from Bangalore,
- 20.62% from Chennai,    
- 14.03% from Delhi,         
- 23.73% from Kolkata, and   
- 23.85% from Mumbai.     

2. The scatterplot revealed no explicit relationship between the price of products and the number of products sold over different locations.
   
3. It was inferred that overall, skincare generates the highest revenue, accounting for 41.83 % of the total revenue.
